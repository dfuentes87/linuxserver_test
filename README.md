# linuxserver_test
Ansible playbook to setup then break a LAMP server for testing basic Linux skills. 

### This is a work in progress. 

#### Right now the script will only install Apache, Nginx (setting it up as a reverse proxy), MariaDB, PHP 7.3, and WordPress. The script may have bugs and is not optimized, especially in how to handle failures.
